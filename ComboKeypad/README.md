## VARIABLES
The Buttons[] variable holds the PINS that the buttons are connected to, it goes {FIRST, SECOND...etc}. 

(FOR NOW) The numbers that is entered goes 1,2,3...etc, so ZERO does not exists, to change this, just remove the +1 in pressButton function (num + 1)

## BASIC
When I built this I only had 4 buttons, but you can add how many buttons as you want(In theory...). There is an image in this folder to see how I connected it all
